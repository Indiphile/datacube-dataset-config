  title: Australian Geoscience Data Cube Landsat Pixel Quality Assessment
  summary: Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper Analysis Ready data prepared by Geoscience Australia on behalf of the Australian Government.
  source: Pixel Quality Assessment from NBAR v2.0 and Level1
  history: This data represents a tile and reprojection of Landsat Pixel Quality Assessment scene data. The Australian Reflectance Grid (ARG) data is derived from Landsat data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The data is acquired by Geoscience Australia from its ground station in Alice Springs, or directly from the USGS. The data are processed using the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) at the Australian National University (ANU). The data is processed to Level 1 Standard Terrain Corrected Imagery and then to Optical Surface Reflectance using the USGS Landsat Product Generation System and GA's Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) algorithm. NBAR and Level1 products are used to generate the Pixel Quality Assessment product.
